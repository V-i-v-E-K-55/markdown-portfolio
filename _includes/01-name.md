Vehicular networks are emergent technologies that deserve attention of industries and academics institution. They are a subset of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks, which provides a distinguished approach for intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The comparison study of routing Protocols in VANET is an important and crucial for developing smart ITS. This paper present different types of routing protocols, based on different studies, discuss the main differences and application of them. The paper contain a recapitulative comparing tabular of different types and routing protocols and conclude with a Taxonomy of various routing protocols in VANET.
